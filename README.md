# C-Sharp-EXIF-Photo-Data-Editor
This program allows for the user to view and edit EXIF data in .jpg files.
This program only works on Windows and due to the library limitations it can’t add metadata to a photo, so it can only edit metadata of photos that already has metadata in it.\
You can get the EXIFLibrary (it’s included so you don’t have to download it) here: https://github.com/oozcitak/exiflibrary
